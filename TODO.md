# TODO's

- Make sure the easter egg in E2M8 works (see "4.7.5.4 Call Apogee" in the Game Engine Black Book)
- Hardcoded ceiling color (see 4.7.4 in Game Engine Black Book)
- I don't remember why I've called "sprites" for "actors". According to the Black Book,
  actors are AI entities, not static objects. Consider renaming.
- Reduce the number of visible sprites by only dealing with those that are in visible
  tiles. This is described in the Black Book (4.7.8.1)
